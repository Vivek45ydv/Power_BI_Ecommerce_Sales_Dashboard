# Power_BI_Ecommerce_Sales_Dashboard
I've Created sales board to track and analyze the online sales data. 
Used complex parameters to drill down in worksheet and customizing using filters and slicers 
Created connections, join new tables, calculations to manipulate data and enable user driven parameters for vizualizations. 

Used different types of customized vizualization (bar chart, pie chart, donut chart, clustered bar chart, scatter chart, line chart, area chart, map, slicers etc)

This gives a quick understanding to the manager/stake holder’s about the company's performance in key areas: The dashboard includes key performance indicators (KPI) such as Total Profit, Total Sales, Total Quantity, and shipping cost, Total Customers, Avg Delivery days as well as a breakdown of sales by segment, category, and Market, Filters, Donut Charts, pie chart, Top Profiting Product’s, Top Customer’s and many more…
